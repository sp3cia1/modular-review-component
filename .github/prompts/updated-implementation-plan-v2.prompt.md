# Frontend-Only Implementation Plan: E-commerce Review Component

## Overview
This plan focuses exclusively on developing a standalone frontend review component that can later be integrated with a backend. For development and testing purposes, we'll use mock data and simulated API services rather than connecting to a real backend.

## Context from Provided Backend Files

From the backend files provided, we understand:

1. **Review Structure**:
   - Product reviews include `title`, `description`, and `rating` fields
   - Reviews are associated with a product (`productId`) and customer (`customerId`)
   - Reviews have timestamps (`createdAt`)
   - Ratings are on a scale of 1-5

2. **API Structure** (for reference only - we'll mock these):
   - Add Review: `POST /add-review` (requires auth)
   - Get Reviews: `GET /get-reviews/:productId` (requires auth)
   - Edit Review: `PUT /edit-review/:reviewId` (requires auth)

## Frontend Implementation Approach

### 2. Mock Data and Services

#### Mock Data Structure
We'll create a comprehensive set of mock reviews to simulate various scenarios:

```javascript
// in mockData/reviews.js
export const mockReviews = [
  {
    _id: "r1",
    productId: "p1",
    customerId: "c1", // We'll assume current user is "c1"
    title: "Great product!",
    description: "This is exactly what I was looking for. The quality is excellent.",
    rating: 5,
    createdAt: "2025-04-15T10:30:00Z" 
  },
  {
    _id: "r2",
    productId: "p1",
    customerId: "c2",
    title: "Good but could be better",
    description: "I like the product but there are a few things that could be improved.",
    rating: 4,
    createdAt: "2025-04-10T14:20:00Z"
  },
  // Add 10-15 more reviews with different ratings, dates, and users
  // Include some reviews from "c1" (current user) for edit testing
  // Ensure distribution across all star ratings (1-5)
];
```

#### Mock Services
We'll create simulated API services that mimic backend behavior using the mock data:

```javascript
// in mockServices/reviewService.js
import { mockReviews } from '../mockData/reviews';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'; // For generating IDs

// Simulate get reviews API
export const getProductReviews = (productId) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // Simulate network delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      const reviews = mockReviews.filter(review => review.productId === productId);
      resolve({ 
        success: true, 
        message: "Reviews retrieved successfully.", 
        data: { reviews } 
      });
    }, 300);
  });
};

// Simulate add review API
export const addReview = (reviewData) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const newReview = {
        _id: uuidv4(),
        ...reviewData,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
      };
      
      // In a real app, we would add to the database
      // Here we just return the new review
      resolve({
        success: true,
        message: "Review added successfully.",
        data: newReview
      });
    }, 500);
  });
};

// Simulate edit review API
export const editReview = (reviewId, reviewData) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const reviewIndex = mockReviews.findIndex(r => r._id === reviewId);
      
      if (reviewIndex === -1) {
        reject({
          success: false,
          message: "Review not found."
        });
        return;
      }
      
      // In a real implementation, we'd check if the current user
      // is the author, but for mock purposes we'll assume they are
      
      const updatedReview = {
        ...mockReviews[reviewIndex],
        ...reviewData
      };
      
      resolve({
        success: true,
        message: "Review updated successfully.",
        data: updatedReview
      });
    }, 500);
  });
};
```

- Review titles: 16px, semi-bold (500 weight)
- Review text: 14px, regular (400 weight)
- Dates and secondary info: 12px, light (300 weight)

#### Component Styling
- **Review Section Container**
  - Max width: 900px
  - Padding: 20px
  - Background: White

- **Review Stats**
  - Prominent average rating (large number + stars)
  - Distribution bars: 8px height, rounded corners
  - Progress bars: Brand color with opacity for background

- **Review Items**
  - Card-like appearance with subtle shadow
  - Rounded corners (8px)
  - Padding: 16px
  - Margin between items: 16px
  - Border: 1px solid #E9ECEF or subtle shadow

- **Star Rating**
  - Size: 20px for display, 24px for input
  - Color: #FFC93C for filled, #E9ECEF for empty

- **Buttons**
  - Primary: Solid fill with brand color
  - Secondary: Outlined or subtle background
  - Rounded corners (4-8px)
  - Padding: 8px 16px

- **Form Elements**
  - Input height: 40-44px
  - Border: 1px solid #CED4DA
  - Border radius: 4-8px
  - Focus state: Highlight with brand color

#### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile** (< 576px)
  - Single column layout
  - Full width components
  - Stacked statistics
  - Star input should be large enough for touch (min 44px)

- **Tablet** (576px - 992px)
  - Statistics may use two-column layout
  - Review list remains single column
  - Increased padding and spacing

- **Desktop** (> 992px)
  - Two-column layout possible for statistics
  - Optimized spacing and layout
  - Hover effects for interactive elements

### 6. Development Assumptions
For the purpose of this frontend-only implementation:

1. **Authentication**
   - We'll assume the user is always authenticated
   - Mock a "current user" ID (e.g., "c1") to test edit functionality

2. **Author Verification**
   - Reviews with `customerId` matching our mock "current user" ID will show edit options
   - All other reviews will not show edit options

3. **Backend Integration**
   - All API calls will be simulated using mock services
   - The component should be structured to easily replace mock services with real API calls later

### 7. Component Testing Approach

1. **Visual Testing**
   - Test component with different mock data sets
   - Verify responsive behavior across device sizes
   - Check styling matches the mockups

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Test filter functionality
   - Verify form validation
   - Test add/edit flows with mock services

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty review list
   - Single review
   - All reviews have same rating
   - Very long review text
   - Very short review text

### 8. Deliverables

1. **Component Library**
   - All React components as outlined
   - Mock data and services
   - Utility functions

2. **Styling**
   - CSS/SCSS files
   - Responsive design

3. **Documentation**
   - Usage instructions
   - Props documentation
   - Future integration notes

### 9. Future Integration Notes

When integrating with a real backend:

1. Replace mock services with actual API calls
2. Implement proper authentication checks
3. Use real user and product IDs
4. Add proper error handling for API responses
5. Implement real-time updates if needed
