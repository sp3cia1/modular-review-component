# Product Requirements Document: Frontend Review Component

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a standalone frontend review component that can be used in an e-commerce application. The component will be developed exclusively on the frontend using mock data for development and testing.

### 1.2 Scope
The review component will be built in React and will include review display, statistics, filtering, and simulated CRUD operations. The component will be designed to eventually integrate with a backend API but will initially operate independently using mock data.

### 1.3 Context
We have been provided with two backend code files that inform us about the structure of reviews and available API endpoints. These files indicate:

1. **Review Schema**: Reviews contain `productId`, `customerId`, `title`, `description`, `rating` (1-5), and `createdAt` fields.
2. **API Endpoints**: There are endpoints for adding reviews, getting product reviews, and editing reviews.

However, for this project, we are only creating the frontend and will not have access to the actual backend.

### 1.4 Target Audience
- End users who will interact with the review component
- Frontend developers who will integrate the component into the broader application

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Description
A modular, responsive review component that displays product reviews with user information, ratings, and timestamps. It includes statistical information about ratings distribution and allows users to filter reviews by star rating.

### 2.2 Vision Statement
To create a visually appealing, user-friendly review component that enhances the shopping experience by providing clear and organized product feedback.

## 7. Mock Data Specifications

### 7.1 Review Object Structure
```javascript
{
  _id: String,               // Unique identifier
  productId: String,         // Product identifier
  customerId: String,        // Customer identifier (for author checking)
  title: String,             // Review headline
  description: String,       // Review content

  createdAt: String          // ISO date string
}
```

### 7.2 Mock Data Requirements

- Distribution across all star ratings (1-5)
- Varying dates (recent and older)
- Mix of short and long review texts
- Some reviews from "current user" (for edit testing)

## 8. Component Props

### 8.1 Main Component
```javascript
<ReviewSection
  productId={string}          // Product identifier
  currentUserId={string}      // For identifying user's own reviews
  onAddReview={Function}      // Optional callback when review is added
  onEditReview={Function}     // Optional callback when review is edited
  theme={Object}              // Optional theming overrides
/>
```

### 8.2 Configurable Options
- Initial filter state
- Show/hide add review button
- Custom avatar URL function
- Date formatting options

## 9. Implementation Assumptions

For this frontend-only implementation, we make the following assumptions:

1. **Authentication**: We assume the user is authenticated and can leave reviews.
2. **Author Verification**: Reviews with `customerId` matching our mock "current user" ID are editable.
3. **Product Context**: The component will operate within a product context but doesn't need product data other than ID.
4. **Backend Integration**: All API calls will be simulated with mock services.

## 10. Testing Approach

### 10.1 Visual Testing
- Test with different quantities of reviews
- Verify responsive layouts across breakpoints
- Check styling matches mockups

### 10.2 Functional Testing
- Test filter functionality
- Verify form validation rules
- Test add/edit flows with mock services

### 10.3 Edge Cases
- Empty state (no reviews)
- All 5-star reviews
- Very long review text
- Reviews with minimum/maximum allowed characters
